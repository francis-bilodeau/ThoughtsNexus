# Intro

What conceptual breakthrough could enable AGI?

In 10, 50, or even 100 years, will AI technologies converge toward a specific type of algorithm? Or will they diverge into many different ones? What might such algorithms look like?

These are questions I have thought about extensively. 
After countless hours of brainstorming and conceptualizing possible solutions, this essay series presents some of the most intriguing insights I have encountered. 

I argue that a conceptual framework, referred to as **Artificial Stem Neurons (ASN)**, could introduce a significant paradigm shift for advancing AI in the future. This framework might provide the foundation for developing efficient and aligned AGIs by enabling the creation of **Emergent Neural Algorithms (ENA)**.

This essay series is divided into four main sections. Part one, **Emergence and Complexity**, discusses how complex intelligence emerged and could be artificially emerged. Part two, **An Ideal ML Algorithm**, hypothesizes the ideal proprieties of a perfect machine learning algorithm. Part three, **Artificial Stem Neuron,** presents in detail the conceptual framework that could enable emerging AGIs. Finally, in **RoadMap**, a plan and ideas are shared for researching Artificial Stem Neurons and Emergent Neural Algorithms.

## Main Section Overviews

### Emergence and Complexity

There are still many significant high-level differences between artificial and natural neural networks. Biological brains are efficient algorithms and highly complex systems. Their cognitive capabilities result from an accumulation of emergent properties through evolution. Understanding the emergence of intelligence might help us transcend the current limitations of machine learning. It could enable the development of highly complex and efficient AIs, allowing us to focus on their usefulness rather than their intricacies.

### An Ideal ML Algorithm

What would be the ultimate machine learning algorithm? We don't know yet, but we can try imagining its capabilities. It can be conceptualized as a black box with inputs, outputs, and/or reward signals. Whatever the task at hand, this black box would act as the optimal algorithm for that particular task. It would produce the best generalization performance with the least amount of resources. It would learn optimally from a reward signal. If the task requires it to be an AGI, it would be controllable and aligned.


### Artificial Stem Neurons

Emergent Neural Algorithms (ENA) might be the key to creating AGIs. To make them a reality, we need a computationally efficient framework that enables the stacking of emergent proprieties. Artificial Stem Neurons could be the fundamental units of such a framework. Different ASN strains could be evolved for specific or general purposes. Unlike simple artificial neurons, ASNs need more advanced components to create ENAs. In the long term, ASNs could approach ideal ML algorithm capabilities.


### RoadMap

Investigating the usefulness of ASN will require a significant coordinated effort. First, we need a new high-performance ML framework centered around the concept of collective intelligence. This framework will facilitate researching ENA. Multiple different avenues of research could be investigated: fundamental agent types, agent variability, encoding neural expertise, ENAs, emergent proprieties staking, AGIs, algorithmic efficiency, real-time learning, transversal learning, and potentially others.
