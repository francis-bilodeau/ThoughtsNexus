My name is Francis Bilodeau. I am a MASc robotics engineer and a self-taught computer and machine learning scientist.

Constantly brainstorming about life, sciences, and technologies, I have accumulated some interesting ideas over the years, some of which might hopefully make it here.

I initially created this website to share my vision of [How to Emerge AGI](/HowtoEmergeAGI/Intro/).
