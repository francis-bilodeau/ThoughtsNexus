Or will they diverge into many different ones? What might such algorithms look like?</p> <p>These are questions I have thought about extensively.  After countless hours of brainstorming and conceptualizing possible solutions, this essay series presents some of the most intriguing insights I have encountered. </p> <p>I argue that a conceptual framework, referred to as Artificial Stem Neurons (ASN), could introduce a significant paradigm shift for advancing AI in the future. This framework might provide the foundation for developing efficient and aligned AGIs by enabling the creation of Emergent Neural Algorithms (ENA).</p> <p>Artificial Stem Neurons, like their biological counterparts, would diversify into specific neuron types. These could then connect and interact in particular ways to form complex neural structures and collective intelligences. Through an iterative exploratory process, we could evolve ASN capabilities and create algorithms that are neural in nature. In other words, these new algorithms would be emergent properties of diversified ASN networks.</p> <p>These Emergent Neural Algorithms could enable us to surpass current AIs by enabling the creation of algorithms more complex and efficient than we can design \"by hand.\"</p> <p>In a sense, the human brain is an ENA that is tuned for the survival of our species. We could tune artificial ENAs exactly as we want, for specific or general purposes. This could help us bridge the gap between present AIs' abilities and our own cognitive abilities.</p> <p>This essay series is divided into four main sections. Part one, Emergence and Complexity, discusses how complex intelligence emerged and could be artificially emerged. Part two, An Ideal ML Algorithm, hypothesizes the ideal proprieties of a perfect machine learning algorithm. Part three, Artificial Stem Neuron, presents in detail the conceptual framework that could enable emerging AGIs.

We don't know yet, but we can try imagining its capabilities. It can be conceptualized as a black box with inputs, outputs, and/or reward signals. Whatever the task at hand, this black box would act as the optimal algorithm for that particular task. It would produce the best generalization performance with the least amount of resources. It would learn optimally from a reward signal.

At the core of these advanced neural networks would be Artificial Stem Neurons (ASN), which differentiate and exhibit unique behaviors analogous to biological stem neurons. Various ASN strains could be evolved to serve either specific or general purposes, and over time, these strains could potentially match the capabilities of ideal machine learning algorithms.
